# jointPRO: Joint Models for Longitudinal PRO and Survival Data

This repository contains a collection of functions and examples to perform **joint model analysis** for **longitudinal patient-reported outcomes (PRO)** and **time-to-event (survival) data**. These tools support researchers working in clinical trials or observational studies where analyzing repeated measures alongside survival outcomes is essential.

##  Features

- Models longitudinal PRO scores using the **Beta-Binomial distribution**
- Survival sub-models implemented via the **Cox proportional hazards model**
- Supports both **Bayesian** and **frequentist** estimation approaches
- Implements **two-stage** and **one-stage** modeling frameworks
- Includes **simulated datasets** for testing and demonstration
- Functions for **visualization** and **diagnostics**
- Tools for **dynamic prediction** of survival probabilities
